                    Intel (integrated and electronics) was founded on July 18, 1968, 
                    by semiconductor pioneers Gordon Moore (of Moore's law) and Robert Noyce (1927–1990), 
                    and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove. 
                    Intel was a key component of the rise of Silicon Valley as a high-tech center. 
                    Noyce was a key inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip). 
                    Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, 
                    which represented the majority of its business until 1981. 
                    Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, 
                    it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business.
